The platform is designed for a variety of quantitative finance and machine learning applications:

*   **Quantitative Research and Strategy Development:** Users can visually design, test, and refine complex multi-step quantitative strategies, including factor mining, model validation, and portfolio optimization. The visual workflow editor simplifies the process of connecting data sources, feature engineering, and model training nodes.
*   **Algorithmic Trading:** The system supports strategy backtesting with a high-performance, event-driven engine for both stocks and futures. Strategies proven in backtesting can be deployed for real-time trading execution via the dedicated `panda_trading` module.
*   **Financial Data Analysis:** The platform can be used for general market research, data cleaning, and statistical analysis, leveraging its integration with powerful libraries like Pandas and Statsmodels.
*   **Machine Learning in Finance:** It provides a complete pipeline for developing and deploying financial prediction models, such as those for stock price forecasting or risk assessment, using integrated algorithms like XGBoost, LightGBM, and TensorFlow. The planned LLM support further extends its application to intelligent investment advisory.
